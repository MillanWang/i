# Welcome to my Personal Website Source Code Repository
https://millanwang.github.io/i/#/
Creating this site was my first introduction to React, and it has quickly become my favourite front end framework.

## TSX Component Structure
TSX components will follow the following structure. I feel that having everything related to a component in the same file helps to keep things organized, avoids jumping between files, and leads to less surprises with MaterialUI/ThemeProvider
- Component prop type definitions
- Function to create an object for the component's props
- The component itself
- Subcomponents
    - Subcomponent prop type definitions
    - Functions to create the subcomponent's props
    - The subcomponent itself
- All styles/themes in order of appearance 

## Future
Check out ToDoList.txt for improvements that I plan to implement to the site. However, it might take some time cause looking for work, working, my engineering project, and my last year of university are my current focuses.
