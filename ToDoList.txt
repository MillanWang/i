TODO LIST

-Address TODOs throughout code. Mostly related to css optimization and theming stuff at this time

-HeaderBar
    -Figure out why Navigation toolbar images popout of the toolbars when the window is resized.

-Education page 
    -Change whole thing to match the main color theme. Bright white is brutal on the eyes. 
    -Extract the white background from the carleton image by making it transparent with rgba-alpha cause that's the own barrier right now. 
    -Refer to the MaterialUI/Colors/BlueGray for hex codes if needed

-Projects & Extracurriculars
    -These pages are honestly pretty much the same thing with different input data.
    -Should be able to make a general component that can be used for both

-Find a better way to organize all of the input data. Probably better to be separated into different files and then imported

-Better optimize the site for viewing on mobile and smaller screens. 
    -Eg, do a vertical stack of cards instead of making them all skinny to fit.
    -Nav bar needs a mobile specific implementation cause a vertical stack of buttons will be awkward. Maybe a sidebar?

-Implement some unit and integration tests. 
    -Not having an enforced "No test, no pull request" rule shouldn't be taken as an instruction to ignore testing

-Implement another tab to show of skills with APIs and making requests. 
    -What if employers don't trust the work experience I have with it and want to see it in action?
    -Could be something like a dedicated contact page that APIs to an email sender or something like that.
    
- Investigate WebGL and OpenGL for some 3D graphics. This stuff is real cool
