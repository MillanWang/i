TODO LIST

-Address TODOs throughout code. Mostly related to css optimization and theming stuff at this time

-Education page 
    -Change whole thing to match the main color theme. Bright white is brutal on the eyes. 
    -Extract the white background from the carleton image by making it transparent with rgba-alpha cause that's the own barrier right now. 
    -Refer to the MaterialUI/Colors/BlueGray for hex codes if needed

-Implement some unit and integration tests. 
    -Not having an enforced "No test, no pull request" rule shouldn't be taken as an instruction to ignore testing
    -But realistically, still gotta interally debate how useful it is to have tests that just check if things are there.
        -Personally set requirements of this site are super dynamic. A lot of effort put into tests gets killed with every requirement change. 
            -Feels like I'm doing this so that recruiters think I'm competent in testing instead of the testing actually being helpful for my usecase
            -Passing tests are never a bad thing though...

-Implement another tab to show of skills with APIs and making requests. 
    -What if employers don't trust the work experience I have with it and want to see it in action?
    -Could be something like a dedicated contact page that APIs to an email sender or something like that.
    
- Investigate WebGL and Three.JS for some 3D graphics. This stuff is real cool
